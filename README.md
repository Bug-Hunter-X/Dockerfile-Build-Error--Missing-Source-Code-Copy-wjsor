This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to copy the application's source code into the image.  The original `Dockerfile` misses a crucial `COPY` instruction, resulting in a build failure.  The corrected `Dockerfile_fixed` shows the proper way to include the source code.  This error can be tricky to debug as it doesn't always produce clear error messages, especially if your application has no explicit runtime errors.  Make sure to always check that your application's source code is correctly copied into the Docker image.
